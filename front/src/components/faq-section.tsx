        <p className="text-muted-foreground">
          We recommend servicing your mechanical watch every 3-5 years. Keep your watch away from strong magnetic fields
          and extreme temperatures. Clean your watch regularly with a soft cloth and avoid exposing it to chemicals like
          perfume or chlorine.
